## Architecture

This project follows **Clean Architecture** principles with **BLoC pattern** for state management. The architecture is organized into layers:

### Project Structure

```
lib/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ injection.dart          # Dependency injection setup
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/

‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ domain/            # Business logic layer (entities, usecases)
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ presentation/      # UI layer (pages, widgets, cubits)

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.dart                  # App entry point
```

### Architectural Decisions

#### 1. **Clean Architecture**

- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between data, domain, and presentation layers
- **Dependency Rule**: Dependencies point inward (presentation ‚Üí domain ‚Üí data)
- **Testability**: Each layer can be tested independently

#### 2. **BLoC Pattern with Cubit**

- **State Management**: Using `flutter_bloc` with Cubit for simpler state management
- **Predictable State**: Unidirectional data flow
- **Reactive UI**: UI automatically updates based on state changes

#### 3. **Dependency Injection**

- **GetIt**: Lightweight service locator for dependency injection
- **Lazy Loading**: Services are created only when needed
- **Testability**: Easy to mock dependencies for testing

#### 4. **Navigation**

- **GoRouter**: Declarative routing with deep linking support
- **Route Guards**: Authentication-based route protection
- **Type-Safe**: Compile-time route safety

#### 5. **Form Handling**

- **flutter_form_builder**: Advanced form management with validation
- **Custom Validators**: Reusable validation logic
- **User Experience**: Real-time validation feedback

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow Flutter's official style guide
- Use `flutter_lints` for consistent code quality
- Write meaningful commit messages

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for use cases and repositories
- Widget tests for UI components
- Integration tests for critical user flows

### State Management

- Keep controllers in providers (not UI widgets)
- Use Cubit for simple state management
- Emit states for all UI interactions

## Production Deployment Plan

      - uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
      - run: flutter build ios --release
      - uses: apple-actions/upload-testflight@v1
        with:
          app-path: build/ios/iphoneos/Runner.app
          api-key: ${{ secrets.APPLE_API_KEY }}
          api-key-id: ${{ secrets.APPLE_API_KEY_ID }}
          api-issuer-id: ${{ secrets.APPLE_ISSUER_ID }}
```

### 2. Automated App Store Submission

#### Android (Google Play)

- **Fastlane Integration**: Automated deployment to Google Play Console
- **Release Tracks**: Internal testing ‚Üí Alpha ‚Üí Beta ‚Üí Production
- **Bundle Signing**: Automated APK/AAB signing with release keystore
- **Metadata Management**: Automated screenshots and store listing updates

#### iOS (App Store)

- **Fastlane Match**: Automated certificate and provisioning profile management
- **TestFlight**: Automated upload to TestFlight for beta testing
- **App Store Connect**: Automated submission to App Store Review
- **Code Signing**: Automated signing with distribution certificates

### 3. CI Secrets Management

#### Required Secrets

```bash
# Android
GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON    # Google Play Console service account
ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64            # Release keystore file (base64 encoded)
ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD          # Keystore password
ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS                  # Key alias
ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD               # Key password

# iOS
APPLE_API_KEY                      # App Store Connect API key
APPLE_API_KEY_ID                   # API key identifier
APPLE_ISSUER_ID                    # Team issuer ID
APPLE_DEVELOPER_ACCOUNT            # Apple Developer account email
APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD        # App-specific password
```

#### Security Best Practices

- **Secret Rotation**: Regular rotation of API keys and certificates
- **Access Control**: Minimal required permissions for service accounts
- **Audit Logging**: Track all deployment activities
- **Environment Separation**: Different secrets for staging/production

#### Deployment Strategy

1. **Staging Environment**: Automated deployment to TestFlight/Internal Testing
2. **Production Deployment**: Manual approval required for App Store/Google Play
3. **Rollback Plan**: Quick rollback capability for critical issues
4. **Monitoring**: Post-deployment monitoring and alerting
